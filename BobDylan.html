    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
        Bob Dylan, born Robert Allen Zimmerman, is an American singer-songwriter who 
        is generally regarded as one of the greatest musical artists of all time. Born 
        in Hibbing, Minnesota in 1941, Dylan has been active in the music industry since 
        the early 1960s and has continued to redefine his artistic style and sound. He 
        started his career as a folk singer, using his acoustic guitar and harmonica to
        tackle the complex social issues of his time and earning the nickname "The Voice 
        of his Generation."  Dylan rejected this characterization, and rather than limit 
        himself artistically he stirred controversy by branching out and exploring rock 
        and roll sounds with electrified backing bands. After a legendary run of three 
        albums known as the elctric triolgy, he would return to a more stripped down sound
        and explore American traditional music and country. While this would prove to be 
        less commercially succesful, Dylan would return to the mainstream in the mid 1970s 
        with the release of the personal and heartbreaking album Blood on the Tracks. He has 
        remained hard at work in the half century since, releasing dozens of albums and 
        changing style from gospel to crooner to blues and more. He contniues to tour in 
        support of his latest album, Rough and Rowdy Ways, and shows no signs of stopping 
        anytime soon. He has racked up many honours and accomplishments during his 60 year, 
        including a Nobel Prize for Literature and the number one spot in the Rolling Stone 
        list of the greatest songwriters of all time. <!-- Replace this with the actual biography text -->
