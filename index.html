    <h1>About Me:</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm Harry Burns, and I'm a 4th year student doing a major in political science and minors 
        in musical applications of technology and chemistry. I'm 21 years old and grew up in Toronto, 
        and unfortunately am a fan of all of their sports teams. I am a big fan of classic rock, 
        blues, punk, soul, reggae, and many other sytles of music and have tried to learn these on 
        guitar over the last 6 years. I currently play in a band called Mr. Patterson, which you can 
        check out <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mrpattersonband/">here.</a> My favourite artists 
        include Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, Buddy Guy, The Clash, Joni Mitchell, and the Allman Brothers 
        Band.
